% The two curves are sigmoidal or psychometric functions and saturate to 1
% as the intensity is increased. The two curves differ in their slopes.
% Curve p1 has a steeper slope compared to the curve p2. This implies that 
% the probability of the subject saying that "The red spot is brighter"
% increases rapidly with small changes in brightness in case of p1 but is
% rather slow in case of curve p2. We can also see that the curve p1 is in
% general above the curve p1 indicating that for the same intensity values,
% the probability of the subject saying that "The red spot is brighter" is
% higher in the case of p2.

% Changing the mean of the psychometric function shifts the curve to the right
% along the brightness axis as increasing the mean results in increasing
% the threshold for deciding the response. This can be seen clearly in the

% Changing the standard deviation of the psychometric functions does not
% affect the threshold but affects the slope of the curve. Hence increasing
% the standard deviation would flatten the curve. Specifically, it will
% decrease the probability of calling "Red is brighter" at higher
% intensity levels but increase the probability of calling "Red is
% brighter" at lower intensity levels. This can be seen clearly in the
% figure below:
